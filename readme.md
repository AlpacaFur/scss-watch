# scss-watch

Can be installed globally to watch for changes in the directory it is run. It currently only puts the generated css files into the same directory as the source files. This package will delete a CSS file if the SCSS file with the same name is deleted.

## Usage:
```
  scss-watch <build|watch|help>
    build:   Compiles all the SCSS files in the current directory.
    watch:   Watches for changes and recompiles the changed SCSS files.
    help:    Prints this help menu.
```
